# Stopwatch
What is it? It is a simple python timer that will display a stopwatch in the console.

The code can be run directly for the express purpose of using it as a stopwatch tool. It can also be added to other scripts to integrate a stopwatch into software, and can also be modified to function/change based on user input.
